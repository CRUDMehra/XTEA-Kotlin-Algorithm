# XTEA-Kotlin-Algorithm
The encryption process in the XTEA algorithm is done by taking each plaintext per 8 byte block and breaking it into odd and even rounds. An example of encryption in the XTEA algorithm, if it is known that the key is 16 bytes long and plaintext will be used for encryption with 16 bytes.
